# MalwarePad's Malware Repository

Here I put all the malware I review on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLtGwPFIiZj_tzLCkGyIaZA)

**Malware is fun. But never use it for your own benefit as it is prohibited by the law! We only provide these samples for malware testing and generally for fun**. 

These samples are **malicious** except the special *Joke* category or the with the *[joke]* tag at the end of the filename. 
The password is always *MalwarePad*. 

What else? Nothing. **Enjoy playing with your new malware!**
